  "summary": "Added a shared overtime time formatting utility using 450 minutes per workday and updated the main OvertimeTotals component to use it for composite day/hour/minute display with negative handling. However, the diff summary does not show updates to other places where minutes may be converted to workdays (notably Manager overtime views or any other UI deriving days from minutes).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-69",
      "requirement": "Update all overtime total/conversion displays so that 1 full workday equals 7h30 (450 minutes) everywhere, including any other UI that derives days from minutes, for both Assistants and Managers (including Manager overtime views).",
      "reason": "The diff explicitly updates only `frontend/src/components/overtime/OvertimeTotals.tsx` to use the new 450-minute-per-day composite formatter. The diff summary does not show modifications to any Manager overtime UI or any other components that might convert minutes to days/workdays.",

      "requirement": "Changing the workday conversion rule immediately affects historical overtime totals shown throughout the app (no re-entry needed), everywhere totals are displayed.",
      "reason": "While totals in `OvertimeTotals` will update for existing entries (formatting is purely derived from stored minutes), the diff summary does not provide evidence that *all* other places that display historical totals/composites (including Manager views) were updated to use the new 450-minute rule.",
