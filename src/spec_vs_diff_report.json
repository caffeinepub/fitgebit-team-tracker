  "summary": "All four requested UI polish items appear to be implemented: task dialogs are set to opaque backgrounds in light/dark mode, “(optional)” wording is removed via i18n strings in tasks/overtime, branding shows only the i18n-driven app title “FitGebit” in header and login, and the avatar picker now renders avatars via an SVG-to-data-URI image component with an i18n empty state. However, the diff also includes changes that were not requested (notably role selection/manager token flow on the login screen, and multiple broader functional changes referenced in the file summaries).",

      "reason": "These changes are not part of REQ-28..REQ-31 and conflict with the BuildRequest non-goals (no business-logic changes) and constraint that backend/migrations are not expected for UI-only changes.",
