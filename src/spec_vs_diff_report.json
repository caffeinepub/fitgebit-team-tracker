Backend changes for accepting/storing/validating the caller-provided date are not evidenced in the provided backend diff excerpt. Several unrelated task/manager UI and hook changes appear in the diff summary but were not requested.",

      "reason": "The only backend file shown (backend/main.mo) is truncated and the excerpt does not include any overtime create API signature change, date storage change, or server-side validation/trap messages. From the provided evidence, we cannot confirm REQ-67 is implemented.",
